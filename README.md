## Overview

The MOA-NLP-Toolkit is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, designed to showcase the capabilities of advanced natural language processing (NLP) using a Mixture of Agents (MoA) approach.

## Features

- **Summarization**: Automatically condenses long texts into concise summaries.
- **Question-Answering**: Provides accurate answers to user queries based on given contexts.
- **Text Generation**: Generates new text continuations based on user-provided prompts.
